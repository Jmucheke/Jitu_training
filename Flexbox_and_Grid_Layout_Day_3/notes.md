### Flexbox
1 direction CSS box layout used to align contents vertically and horizontally using rows and columns.

### Note: when flex-direction is set to reverse, the justify-content is also reversed
###### Using justify content
## Note: justify content aligns items horizontally 
flex-start --> items align to the left side of the container
flex-end --> items align to the right of the container

center --> Items align at the center
Space-between --> creates equal spacing between each item
Space-around --> creates equal spacing around the items

##### Align items
Center --> aligns items vertically at the center
Flex-start --> Items will be alligned at the start

gap --> Creates a gap after each item eg, gap: 4px;

Order --> (takes both +ve and -ve values) orders items.e.g order: 1;

Wrap 

#### Growing and shrinking
Flex-basis --> gives hypothetical size, height or widt along the primary axis
in flex row, flex-basis does the same thing as width
in flex column, flex-basis does the same thing as height

Flex-grow --> takes the space remaining
Flex-shrink --> controls how much space is to be removed
